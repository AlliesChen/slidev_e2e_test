# 什麼是 E2E 測試

E2E test 是 end to end test 的簡寫

參考 [What is End-to-End Testing and When Should You Use It? | FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/end-to-end-testing-tutorial/)

> In E2E testing, you create an environment identical to the one that will be used by real users. Then you test all actions that your users might perform on your application.

以網頁前端來說，就是實際呈現給使用者的 UI 介面，也就是網頁的畫面。

> With End-To-End testing, you test entire flows – like logging onto a website or buying a product from an online store.

除了畫面上的元素，也會測試功能的運作流程。

> E2E testing is when you validate your entire application from start to finish, along with any of its dependencies.
